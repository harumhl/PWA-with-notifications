# PWA-with-notifications
PWA with notifications using Google Firebase

## How to Run

1. Create `.env.local` file and put below environment variables
```.env
# Firebase hosting
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=

# Firebase messaging
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_WEB_PUSH_CERT_VAPID_KEY=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_CLOUD_MESSAGING_API_AUTH_TOKEN=
```
1. Fill up `.env.local` using env vars from https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>/settings/general
    1. And also from https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>/settings/cloudmessaging
    1. Sadly the only way I could get REACT_APP_FIREBASE_CLOUD_MESSAGING_API_AUTH_TOKEN was via Postman
        1. Add https://fcm.googleapis.com/v1/projects/pwa-with-notifications/messages:send to POST URL
        1. Go to Authorization tab and select Firebase Cloud Messaging API
        1. Log into my gmail account and give access, then I should see the auth token starting `ya29....`
1. Run `npm run start`

# How to view Service Worker console (though not necessary)

1. Go to `chrome://serviceworker-internals` on a new tab
1. Choose the service worker using `firebase-messaging-sw.js` and start it if not already started.
1. Click on Inspect

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Deploy to Firebase

1. `npm run build`
1. `firebase login`
1. `firebase deploy --public build`
    1. Or `firebase deploy  --public build --only hosting:pwa-with-web-push-notifications`

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
